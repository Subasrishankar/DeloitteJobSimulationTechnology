# Deloitte Technology Job Simulation

This repository contains my completed tasks for the **Deloitte Technology Consulting Virtual Experience Program** hosted by [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). Through this simulation, I explored real-world technology consulting tasks involving data reconciliation and Python-based code integration.

## Overview

The simulation focused on:
- Helping a client reconcile and align different data sources
- Combining multiple pieces of code into a unified, functional format using Python
- Documenting the process and outcomes clearly for client communication

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data reconciliation and data integrity checking
- Python programming (combining and debugging multiple scripts)
- Clear technical documentation using Microsoft Word
- Client communication through structured reporting

## Tools Used

- Python (for code merging and testing)
- Microsoft Word (for documentation and summaries)
- Analytical and critical thinking

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to **Deloitte** and **Forage** for providing a valuable opportunity to experience technology consulting through this virtual program.
